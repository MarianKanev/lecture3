            To connect to the suppliers database, you use the connect() function of the psycopg2 module. The connect() function creates a new database session and returns a new instance of the connection class.

            With a connection object, you can create a new cursor to execute an SQL statement and terminate a transaction using either commit() or rollback() method.

            PL/pgSQL Cursor

            Summary: in this tutorial, we will show you how to use PL/pgSQL Cursor and give you some practical examples of using cursors.
            
            A PL/pgSQL cursor allows us to encapsulate a query and process each individual row at a time. We use cursors when we want to divide a large result set into parts and process each part individually. If we process it at once, we may have a memory overflow error.
            
            In addition, we can develop a function that returns a reference to a cursor. This is an efficient way to return a large result set from a function. The caller of the function can process the result set based on the cursor reference.
